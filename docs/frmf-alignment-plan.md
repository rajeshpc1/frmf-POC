# FRMF Alignment Plan for BT101 Architecture

## Current State Assessment
 Strong Foundation: AI classification, deduplication, scalable processing
 Enhancement Needed: Customer interface, forecasting, system integration

## Phase 1: Customer Interface Enhancement (FRMF Stage 1)

### 1.1 Web UI for Feature Requests
```
Component: Customer Portal Lambda + CloudFront
Purpose: Replace API-only access with user-friendly interface
Features:
- Feature request submission form
- Request status tracking
- Non-binding forecast display
- Request history view
```

### 1.2 Status Forecasting System
```
Enhancement: Add forecast fields to data model
New AI Fields:
- forecast_status: submitted|reviewed|1yr|2yr|3yr|archived
- forecast_confidence: 0-1 score
- last_updated: timestamp
- service_team: responsible team identifier
```

### 1.3 Enhanced Data Model
```json
{
  "original_fields": "...",
  "ai_enhancements": "...",
  "frmf_extensions": {
    "forecast_status": "reviewed",
    "forecast_timeline": "1yr",
    "forecast_confidence": 0.85,
    "service_team": "ec2",
    "customer_visible": true,
    "legal_disclaimer_accepted": true,
    "workaround_available": true,
    "workaround_text": "Generated by Claude..."
  }
}
```

## Phase 2: System Integration (FRMF Stage 2)

### 2.1 AWSentral PFR Sync
```
Component: Integration Lambda + EventBridge
Purpose: Bidirectional sync with existing AWS tools
Frequency: Real-time via events + daily batch reconciliation
```

### 2.2 Harbinger Integration
```
Component: API Gateway endpoints for external systems
Purpose: Allow frontline support to access unified data
Security: IAM roles + API keys for different user types
```

### 2.3 Data Synchronization Architecture
```

                    └──────────────────┘
```

## Phase 3: Service Team Self-Service (FRMF Stage 3)

### 3.1 Service Team Portal
```
Component: Service Team API + Web Interface
Purpose: Allow service teams to update forecasts and status
Features:
- Pull service-specific feature requests
- Update forecast status and timelines
- Add customer-facing updates
- Bulk operations for similar requests
```

### 3.2 Automated Escalation System
```
Component: EventBridge Rules + SNS Notifications
Purpose: Auto-escalate stale forecasts
Logic:
- 1yr forecast → escalate at 11 months
- 2yr forecast → escalate at 22 months
- No update in 6 months → auto-escalate
```

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Immediate)
1. Customer Web Interface - Critical for FRMF Stage 1
2. Forecast Status Fields - Core FRMF requirement
3. Legal Disclaimer System - Risk mitigation

### Medium Priority (Next Quarter)
1. AWSentral Integration - FRMF Stage 2 foundation
2. Service Team API - FRMF Stage 3 enabler
3. Automated Escalation - Operational excellence

### Low Priority (Future)
1. GitHub Integration - Nice-to-have for completeness
2. Advanced Analytics - Business intelligence enhancement
3. Mobile Interface - Customer experience improvement

## Technical Enhancements Needed

### 1. Enhanced Claude Prompts
```python
# Add forecast prediction to existing classification
FORECAST_PROMPT = """
Based on this feature request, predict:
1. Likely implementation timeline (1yr/2yr/3yr/archived)
2. Confidence level (0-1)
3. Reasoning for timeline estimate
4. Potential workarounds available

Consider:
- Technical complexity
- Service maturity
- Customer demand signals
- AWS strategic priorities
"""
```

### 2. Customer Authentication
```
Integration: AWS Cognito User Pools
Purpose: Secure customer access to their requests
Features:
- Customer account linking
- Request ownership validation
- Privacy controls (customers see only their requests)
```

### 3. Notification System
```
Component: SNS + SES for customer updates
Triggers:
- Status changes
- Forecast updates
- Workaround availability
- Service team responses
```

## Success Metrics Alignment

### FRMF Success Criteria Mapping
| FRMF Metric | BT101 Implementation |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Response Time Reduction | Claude automation (20min vs 4hr)  |
| Data Synchronization | Multi-system integration  |
| Customer Visibility | Web portal + forecasting  |
| Stakeholder Satisfaction | User feedback collection  |
| Self-Service Capabilities | Service team portal  |

### Additional Metrics to Track
- Customer portal adoption rate
- Forecast accuracy over time
- Duplicate detection precision
- Service team engagement levels
- Customer satisfaction scores

## Risk Mitigation

### Legal Compliance
- Clear non-binding language in UI
- Customer acknowledgment required
- Audit trail for all forecast changes
- Regular legal review of customer-facing content

### Technical Risks
- Claude hallucination monitoring
- Forecast accuracy tracking
- System integration failure handling
- Data consistency validation

### Operational Risks
- Service team adoption incentives
- Customer expectation management
- Escalation process automation
- Performance monitoring at scale

## Conclusion

Your current BT101 architecture provides an excellent foundation for FRMF implementation. The AI-powered classification and scalable data processing are already ahead of typical enterprise solutions. 

Key Next Steps:
1. Build customer web interface (highest impact)
2. Add forecast prediction to Claude workflow
3. Design integration APIs for AWSentral/Harbinger
4. Implement service team self-service portal

This approach will transform your technical proof-of-concept into a comprehensive feature request management platform that aligns with AWS's strategic FRMF vision.
